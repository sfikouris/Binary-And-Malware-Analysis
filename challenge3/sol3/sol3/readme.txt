To Run the code : I have a script. Run the script 
and it should be done make automatically. After make 
finished it will generate auth1_generated.txt 

I Start the challenge filling the TODOs for mov instructions.
Then I went to step 1 and generated all the possible cases for CMP.
(I left out imm with imm and mem with mem because I did some checks 
and no taint values used to those situations).Then I check if the arguments that 
It compares are taint and I propagate the taint value.

For step2 with the help of ltrace I found which libcalls binary use.
strcmp, strncmp, memset, memcpy are the functions that I handle. I propagate 
the taint value if one of the arguments is tainted.

For step3 I handle all the arithmetics with the same idea. I propagate
taint value if the right argument is taint, and also I keep track what was the opcode
and the value of the right argument. 

For Step4 before I create the needed file I check all the characters that had opcode XOR from 
previous step and make them xor again with the saved value to get the actual value that binary needs.
(add,sub and etc I found out that are not needed to do the opposite like i did to xor so I'm not handle them).
