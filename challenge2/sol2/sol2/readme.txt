- I dumped the unpacked binary at 00100167 when it did the jump to rax and rax value is 0x7ffff7dd2090. 
Because after the jump it started to execute instructions from the stack and it looks like the unpacking was finished.

- I also checked with strace at that moment and the mmap had allocate memmory from 0x400000 to 0x485000 so 
    I dump it between those adresses.

- To make elf work I changed the big endian byte to small endian and also I changed the machine byte to 3e. 
Moreover the offset in LOAD section was wrong so I moved bytes from 0x3e10 to 0x2e10 and I added zero bytes to the end.  

-launch code : e0faaa6f0c5a90ff . After dissasembling the unpacked binary at memory 00401211 i found the password QYKDUUXBFODMBVVPNBCU :         
            
             if ((uint)(DAT_004840a0 != 'Q') + (uint)(DAT_004840a1 != 'Y') +
              (uint)(DAT_004840a2 != 'K') + (uint)(DAT_004840a3 != 'D') +
              (uint)(DAT_004840a4 != 'U') + (uint)(DAT_004840a5 != 'U') +
              (uint)(DAT_004840a6 != 'X') + (uint)(DAT_004840a7 != 'B') +
              (uint)(DAT_004840a8 != 'F') + (uint)(DAT_004840a9 != 'O') +

              (uint)(DAT_004840b0 != 'N') + (uint)(DAT_004840b1 != 'B') +
              (uint)(DAT_004840b2 != 'C') + (uint)(DAT_004840b3 != 'U') == 0) 

Anti-Unpacking: I found that at the unpacked version the getauxval(8) function returns the value 0. It checks it twice.
At memory 0040116f, and because it is 0 it doesn't take the jump at memory 0040117c so it prints the massage "SOFTWARE NOT GENUINE; RESULTS UNRELIABLE".
Also at memory 00401345 the getauxval(8) is invoked again. Because the return value is 0x0 it gets in an infinite loop for the reason that it cannot
construct the secret code without the return value from getauxval(8) that it needs to break the loop.

The value that getauxval should return and I should set the $RAX is 0xbe65e0684215bf58.

I couldn't done this patch because ghidra had stop exporting binarys from unpacking version. 
To solve this I had to go to an empty space in the binary and write the value 0xbe65e0684215bf58. 
After I had to go to memory 0040134c and instead of  MOV qword ptr [DAT_004840b8],RAX I should change RAX to the address I written the value before.



-for the scripts. I have created 3 scripts. You have to execute the "run_me_script".
	chmod +x run_me_script
	./run_me_script

It will create 2 binaries, my_dump and after_script_dump
	the binary that runs correct is the after_script_dump
